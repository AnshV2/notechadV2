# popNotesV2

My current system for taking notes and jotting things down is I'll make a notepad and then type in it. Then at night I shut down my computer and notepad is gone. Not great. Also just having multiple notepad's open is a huge mess and there are a lot of problems.

I am hoping to solve this issue through this web app whoooo. Basically make notepads move them around do whatever you want and the ui organizes everything for you in a dashboard-esque style. 

Making this largely for personal use because I need something organized to take small notes in whenever the occassion arrises. I'll add in user auth and database stuff so that anyone can use this not just me. Free public service why not. 


I am Still implementing rn so completely unfinished. Feel free to look through the repo though.
